### GitHub (very brief)
- Use PRs for all changes; keep them small and focused.
- Require at least one review and passing CI before merge.
- Write clear, imperative PR titles; link related issues.
- Prefer squash merge to maintain a clean history.
- Protect `main`; tag releases and update changelog.

### Git (very brief)
- Branch from `main`: `feature/...`, `fix/...`, `chore/...`.
- Commit small and often; imperative present tense (e.g., "Add X").
- Rebase locally before opening/updating PRs; avoid force-push on shared branches.
- Pull with rebase; resolve conflicts early.
- Use `.gitignore`; stash WIP safely; tag versions for releases.

### Basic development environment (very brief)
- Tools: Git, GitHub CLI, PNPM.
- Install with a single manager (prefer winget); avoid mixing with choco/scoop.
- Restart your terminal after installs to refresh PATH.
- Check duplicates on PATH:
```
where.exe git
where.exe gh
where.exe pnpm
```
- Verify tools:
```
git --version
gh --version
pnpm -v
```
- Pin PNPM with Corepack to avoid lockfile churn (use your chosen version, e.g., 9.6.0):
```
corepack enable
corepack prepare pnpm@9.6.0 --activate
```
- In `package.json`, set the package manager:
```json
{
  "packageManager": "pnpm@9.6.0"
}
```
